- 👋 Hi, I’m @bgadd-brad
- 👀 I’m taking an interest in AI, web-development, and game dev. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any of the aformentioned.
- 📫 How to reach me: @ bradleygad@gmail.com

I do have working understandings of C#, web development (HTML, CSS, Javascript), Python, and a bit of C and C++, as well as React.

I am currently working a full-time job that isn't related to programming in any way, so my development times can be a bit slow until I find my groove with things.
